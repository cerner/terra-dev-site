# Terra Dev Site Setup Guide

Using the `TerraDevSite` webpack plugin, a static site will be generated and can be served using `webpack-dev-server` or served statically using something like gh-pages. Extending from `@cerner/webpack-config-terra`'s webpack config is highly recommended.

## WebpackConfig

The following webpackConfig config is a simple example, extending from the reusable terra webpack config and applying the `TerraDevSite` plugin.

```javascript
const terraWebpackConfig = require('@cerner/webpack-config-terra');
const merge = require('webpack-merge');
const { TerraDevSite } = require('@cerner/terra-dev-site');

/**
* Generates the file representing app name configuration.
*/
const devSiteConfig = (env = {}, argv = {}) => ({
  plugins: [
    new TerraDevSite({
      defaultLocale: env.defaultLocale,
    }),
  ],
});

const webpackConfig = (env, argv) => (
  merge(terraWebpackConfig(env, argv), devSiteConfig(env, argv))
);

module.exports = webpackConfig;
```


To serve using `webpack-dev-server`, add the following terra-toolkit command to your package.json. See the [webpack-dev-server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/#root) for more information on the command options.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "webpack-dev-server"
  }
}
```

After adding the start command to your package.json, run it and navigate to http://localhost:8080/ to view the site in your browser:

```bash
npm start
```

You will see your readme hosted on the site. Next lets add some pages.

Terra-dev-site will auto discover files base on either the default search patterns in the site.config or the file structure and file extensions used.

Add the following file to: `<package>/src/terra-dev-site/my-first-page.doc.md`

```md
My first page!
```

Webpack will re-compile and now you should be able to see your page under the components tab.
