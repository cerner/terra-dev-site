# MDX

Terra dev site uses MDX as a markdown loader. MDX allows you to mix JSX syntax into your markdown documents.

To use mdx syntax you must use a .mdx file extension.

For example the following block will render into

```md
# Hello, *world*!

Below is an example of JSX embedded in Markdown. <br /> **Check out
the background color!**

<div style={{ padding: '20px', backgroundColor: 'tomato' }}>
  <h3>This is JSX</h3>
</div>
```

With the output below:
<hr />

# Hello, *world*!

Below is an example of JSX embedded in Markdown. <br /> **Try and change
the background color!**

<div style={{ padding: '20px', backgroundColor: 'tomato' }}>
  <h3>This is JSX</h3>
</div>

<hr />

## MDX loader

Mdx is loaded at build time rather than interpreted at run time. The mdx loader that is used is more strict that the 'marked' library previously used.

The MDX loader requires closing tags. For example the before markdown would fail because the img tag was not closed.

```diff
- <img height="128" width="128" src="https://github.com/cerner/terra-dev-site/raw/main/terra.png" alt="terra logo" >
+ <img height="128" width="128" src="https://github.com/cerner/terra-dev-site/raw/main/terra.png" alt="terra logo" />
```

MDX also has a bug where a comment cannot directly follow a closing tag.

```diff
-<h1>
-hi mom
-</h1>
-<!-- AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:END -->

+<h1>
+hi mom
+</h1>

+<!-- AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:END -->

```
