# Loaders

## Usage

Terra Dev Site offer several webpack loaders to help write easier documentation. The loaders are all accessed through the use of webpacks [resource query](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/module/#ruleresourcequery).

For example to use the example loader you would require your example with the `?dev-site-example` resource query.

```jsx
import Example from './example?dev-site-example';
```

## CodeBlock Loader

The codeblock loader will take the passed in file and return an mdx react component containing a codeblock with the source of the passed in file and a type of the file extension.

For example:

```jsx
import Example from './example?dev-site-example';
```

Will render to:

```md
```js
import React from 'react';

const TagComp = () => (
  <h1>
    I am a test
  </h1>
);

export default TagComp;
```
```

## Example Loader

```jsx
import Example from './example?dev-site-example';
```

## Package

```jsx
import { Badge } from './pretendPackage.json?dev-site-package';
```
