# v7.0.0 Upgrade Guide

This document will provide information on upgrading from Terra Dev Site `6.x.x` to `7.0.0`.

## Reasoning for major version bump

With stricter markdown parsing, existing dev-sites may fail with this update.

## MDX loader

Markdown is now loaded at build time rather than interpreted at run time. The mdx loader that is used is more strict that the 'marked' library previously used.

The MDX loader requires closing tags. For example the before markdown would fail because the img tag was not closed.

```diff
- <img height="128" width="128" src="https://github.com/cerner/terra-dev-site/raw/master/terra.png" alt="terra logo" />
+ <img height="128" width="128" src="https://github.com/cerner/terra-dev-site/raw/master/terra.png" alt="terra logo" >
```

MDX also has a bug where a comment cannot directly follow a closing tag.

```diff
-<h1>
-hi mom
-</h1>
-<!-- AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:END -->

+<h1>
+hi mom
+</h1>

+<!-- AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:END -->

```
