# Loaders

Terra Dev Site offer several webpack loaders to help write easier documentation. The loaders are all accessed through the use of webpacks [resource query](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/module/#ruleresourcequery).

For example to use the example loader you would require your example with the `?dev-site-example` resource query.

```jsx
import Example from './example?dev-site-example';
```
