## Line Breaks

Here's a line for us to start with.

This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*.

This line is also begins a separate paragraph, but...
This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the *same paragraph*.

(Technical note: *Markdown Here* uses GFM line breaks, so there's no need to use MD's two-space line breaks.)
