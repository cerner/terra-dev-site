# How to release

This project is hosted on NPM.  You can find the terra packages [here][project-url].

Below is a guide for releasing packages:

1. Update the versions of the component and change log via `npm run prepare-for-release`
2. Create a Release PR, Get approvals
3. Merge PR to `main`
4. Watch main to ensure releases get pushed to npm and tagged in github appropriately
